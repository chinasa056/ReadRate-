# ReadRate â€“ Book Review API

A backend API for a book review system, built with Node.js, TypeScript, MySQL, and Redis. Users can register, authenticate, admin add books, and post one review per book. Supports secure JWT authentication, Redis caching, and is ready for CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions.

---

## Project Overview

**ReadRate** is a scalable and secure RESTful API for managing a book review system. It allows users to sign up, authenticate, browse books, and leave reviews â€” all while optimizing performance with Redis caching and safeguarding access via JWT authentication.

### Key Features

* User registration & login with JWT-based authentication
* Refresh token rotation for secure session renewal
* CRUD operations for books
* Users can leave exactly one review per book (CRUD supported)
* Automatic average rating calculation per book
* Search books by title/author with Redis caching
* Pagination for book listings
* Secure middleware-protected routes
* Dockerized for consistent local and production builds
* CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions
* Deployable to Render or similar platforms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js â‰¥ 18.x
* MySQL â‰¥ 8.x
* Redis
* Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
* Git & GitHub
* [Render](https://render.com) account (for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chinasa056/ReadRate-.git
cd ReadRate-
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Setup environment variables:

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# MySQL
DATABASE_NAME=your_db
DATABASE_USERNAME=your_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_pass
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_DIALECT=mysql

# Redis
REDIS_CLIENT_USERNAME=default
REDIS_CLIENT_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
REDIS_CLIENT_HOST=localhost
REDIS_CLIENT_PORT=6379

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
```

4. Start MySQL and Redis (if not already running):

Or use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

5. Run database migrations:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Server runs at: [https://readrate-api.onrender.com/](https://readrate-api.onrender.com/)
